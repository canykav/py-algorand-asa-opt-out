# Python Algorand Opt-Out Transaction
Opt-out action is using to remove the permission to host the asset. After the transaction, your locked algo coins for the asset is released in Algorand Blockchain.

I have prepared a completely ready-made code using the these Algorand API's and docs:

https://developer.algorand.org/docs/sdks/python/

https://py-algorand-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algosdk/transaction.html#algosdk.transaction.AssetTransferTxn

## Requirements
Run  `$ pip3 install py-algorand-sdk`

## Usage
Replace your wallet and asset variables. That is all.
Run  `$ py optout.py` or    `$ py multiple-optout.py` according to your requirement.

## My Usage Experience
I opt-outed my 1000 assets in escrow wallet. It takes a while but it's perfect.
